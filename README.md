# meet_app

## Objective

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

For this app, youâ€™ll be using a TDD approach, where you write tests before writing the actual functionality for your app in code. Writing tests forces you to focus on the requirements of your
application before jumping into the code. TDD relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle, allowing you to get immediate feedback and deliver high-quality code.

The main goal of this project is to develop a PWA that combines the benefits of serverless architecture and PWAs, with the following features:

-	Serverless: No backend maintenance, easy to scale, always available, no cost for idle time.
-	PWAs: Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, "add to home screen" prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.
